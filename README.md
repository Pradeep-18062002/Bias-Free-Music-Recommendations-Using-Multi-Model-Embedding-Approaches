#  Melodify: Bias-Free Music Recommendation System

Introduction

Melodify is an innovative music recommendation system designed to address the limitations of traditional approaches, such as relying heavily on user listening history or predefined audio features. Our solution integrates advanced content-based and metadata-based models to better understand the multifaceted nature of music, capturing its lyrical, auditory, and contextual dimensions. This ensures recommendations that are unbiased and cater to user preferences while promoting diversity.

Problem Addressed

Music recommendation systems often face challenges like:

Cold Start Problem: Ineffectiveness in scenarios with limited user data.
Popularity Bias: Overemphasis on well-known tracks, sidelining emerging artists.
Simplistic Features: Failure to encapsulate the full artistic and emotional value of music.
Methodology
Our system leverages a hybrid approach combining content-based embedding models and metadata-based techniques:



Content-Based Models:

Audio Embeddings: Extracted features from song audio using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to generate compact, meaningful representations.
Tag Word2Vec Embeddings: Processed song tags using Word2Vec to capture semantic relationships.

Metadata-Based Models:

Graph Embedding: Utilized Node2Vec on a heterogeneous graph of songs, artists, and tags to model relationships.
XGBoost Classification: Incorporated artist metadata, listener counts, and semantic embeddings for artist recommendations.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Captured sequential patterns in audio data for improved similarity detection.


Data Sources:

Million Song Dataset: Features from 17,636 songs were analyzed to ensure diversity.
Last.fm Dataset: Metadata and user interaction data from 28,743 songs enhanced the systemâ€™s context-awareness.




Results and Insights:
Content-based models demonstrated independence from popularity metrics, effectively mitigating bias.
Metadata-based models highlighted strong relationships between song metadata and user preferences.
Clustering and cosine similarity metrics validated the system's ability to recommend meaningful and diverse song matches.




Achievements:

Unbiased Recommendations: Lesser-known and emerging artists gained equitable exposure.
High Accuracy: Models achieved up to 53% accuracy in tag-based embeddings, showing promise for scalable systems.
Inclusive Ecosystem: Diverse music content surfaced based on intrinsic features rather than historical trends.




Future Enhancements:

To improve and expand the system, the following areas will be explored:

Increasing dataset size and diversity.
Experimenting with larger embedding dimensions and advanced hyperparameters.
Incorporating raw audio signals for richer feature extraction.



Conclusion:

Melodify redefines music recommendations by integrating unsupervised learning techniques and mitigating biases inherent in traditional systems. It paves the way for a fair, scalable, and inclusive music recommendation ecosystem, offering personalized experiences while promoting diversity in the music industry.
